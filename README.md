# ðŸš§ WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§

This project is work in progress and subject to frequent changes as we are still working on wiring up each individual node component into a full syncing pipeline.

It has not been audited for security purposes and should not be used in production yet.

We will be updating the documentation with the completion status of each component, as well as include more contributing guidelines (design docs, architecture diagrams, repository layouts) and "good first issues". See the "Contributing and Getting Help" section above for more.

We appreciate your patience until we get there. Until then, we are happy to answer all questions in the Telegram link above.
